## Introduction
This project implements the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) BB84 protocol using Amazon Braket SDK. Quantum Key Distribution allows two parties to produce a shared random secret key, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring secure communication based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later.
- Amazon Braket SDK.

## Installation
1. Ensure that Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system.
2. Install Amazon Braket SDK using pip:
`pip install amazon-braket-sdk`
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:
`git clone <repository_url>`
4. Navigate to the cloned repository.

## Usage
To run the QKD simulation:
1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run the script using Python:
`python qkd_braket.py`

## Project Structure
- `qkd_braket.py`: The main Python script that implements the QKD protocol using Amazon Braket.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
